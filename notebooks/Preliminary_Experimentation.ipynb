I came in at that weird time between lunch and dinner rush. Regardless, the bartender was super friendly. He chatted me up about all of the local beers they have. I finally settled on a Schlafly pumpkin because it's me and it's fall. I didn't have pizza on this visit (not because it isn't amazing because it is, but because I couldn't eat a whole pizza on my own). Instead I ordered a Cesar salad and the meatball appetizer. \\nFirst off the salad was freaking huge!!! It was tasty for a Cesar salad though they really are hard to mess up.

pizza so much that i had to come back. i was the only person in the place. i came in at that weird time between lunch and dinner rush. regardless, the bartender was super friendly. he chatted me up about all of the local beers they have. i finally settled on a schlafly pumpkin because it's me and it's fall. i didn't have pizza on this visit (not because it isn't amazing because it is, but because i couldn't eat a whole pizza on my own). instead i ordered a cesar salad and the meatball appetizer. first off the salad was freaking huge!!! it was tasty for a cesar salad though they really are hard to mess up. the meatball appetizer was awesome! you get about 5 meatballs in sauce and covered with cheese alongside a few pieces of bread. the salad and meatballs were the perfect lunch.
